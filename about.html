					<h1>Welcome</h1>
					<p><br>Tomorrow's Healthcare Professionals (THP) is dedicated to your success and providing the training needed to enter careers in industries that currently have employment opportunities.
						<br><br>
						THP is a group of seasoned healthcare professionals and educators that have worked at other popular "TV" schools, seen the problems, got fed up with battling the bureaucracy and decided that we can do it better, cheaper. So we got together and started our own school.
						<br><br>
						We are committed to building a strong foundation and making you employable for entry level positions upon graduation. These entry-level positions in most cases are stepping stones to higher paying jobs.
						<br><br>
						In our experience, hospitals, doctors and healthcare offices will hire you as long as you have solid basics, a GREAT attitude, the ability to follow detailed instructions and the will to learn. Have those 4 qualities and you're on your way to having a fulfilling career.
						<br><br>
						Right now there are more openings available than there are healthcare professionals to go around!
						<br><br>
						The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics states that by 2022 nearly 4 million healthcare jobs will be created. These opportunities can be yours, call us today at 404-400-2413.
						<br><br>
						The demand is there-why not take advantage of that opportunity?</p>
