					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
					<h4>How Long are the Programs at THP?</h4>
					
					<p>After completing your coursework at THP, you can launch a successful career in a little as 6 weeks! We would prefer that you select another program that is more inclusive, but, if you need to get into the job market faster, you can do it in 6 weeks</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>Will I get Job Placement Assistance?</h4>
					<p>Yes. THP measures its success by the number of students we assist in placing in a new healthcare career
					<br>
					THP, will proactively reach out to you to identify potential employment opportunities in the healthcare field and assist you with resume writing, interviewing and professional development.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>Is Tomorrow's Healthcare Professionals Accredited?</h4>
					<p>No, we are a private institution. While we have strongly considered getting accredited or "authorized" at this time we have chosen to keep tuitions low and remain a private institution
							<br>
					Staying private also allows us the flexibility to change our programs quickly and stay up to date with an ever-changing healthcare industry, without having the bureaucracy of an accreditation commission.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>Can I Schedule a Campus Tour?</h4>
					<p>Yes, better yet we want to invite you to sit in on one of our classes. As a guest in our classroom, you will see exactly how classes are run, so you can decide if it's for you
							<br>
					How does that sound?
					<br>For more information about classroom tours, contact the school at (404) 400-2413.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>How Can I be Assured I will have Personalized Attention?</h4>
					<p>Our formula for success is simple: small classrooms equal more attention to our students' needs.
							<br>
					Class sizes average 10-20 students, which means that you'll have more individual attention from your instructor and your classmates.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>How is THP different from other Schools?</h4>
					<p>"TV" schools evaluate their success on the number of students that they enroll. These enrollments mean BIG BUCKS for the school. THP is different.
					<br>We measure our success by the number of students we assist in placing in a new healthcare career! We truly want to change lives, NOT add to our bottom-line.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>Does THP offer Day and Evening Classes?</h4>
					<p>Yes, however, not all programs are offered in the evenings and only select classes are offered based solely on student interest.
							<br>
					If there are 6-8 students interested in taking the same evening class, we will accommodate those students.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4>Does THP offer Financial Aid?</h4>
					<p>Yes, THP has relationships with alternate no credit check funding sources to help you pay for your education.
							<br>
					When you're really ready to change your life, we will help you find the right source to pay for your education..</p>
